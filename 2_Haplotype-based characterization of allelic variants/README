You can refer to the codes in "work.sh" to reproduce the results reported in our paper

NOTE: the starch_gene_seqs directory contains the reference gene sequences of the 81 starch genes in the potato DM reference genome

the vcf_genome_coordinates directory contains the final merged allelic variants in VCF format for the 81 starch genes across the 24 haplotypes
from the 6 autotetraploid potato genomes

I hereby only provide the codes for analyzing the 81 starch genes; the same procedures were also applied for the 38 SGA genes
